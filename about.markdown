Matt Goldeck is a software engineer. He lives in Boulder, Colorado.

He currently builds backend stuff for ChowNow. He does this remotely.

He grew up in sunny and desirable Erial, New Jersey. He has lived all over the Garden State, including fabulous destinations such as Jersey City, Haddonfield, and Collingswood.

In 2019 he earned his Bachelor of Science in computer science from Montclair State University. He still wishes he went to Rowan but he will deny it if you ask him. He spent a lot of time with databases, NLP, and environmental science.

He has way too many hobbies for one mortal but his favorites include running, climbing, hiking, and fiddling around with projects he will never finish.
