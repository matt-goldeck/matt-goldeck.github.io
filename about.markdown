Matt Goldeck is a software engineer. He lives in Boulder, Colorado.

He currently builds backend stuff for ChowNow. He does this remotely.

He grew up in sunny and desirable Erial, New Jersey and lived all over the Garden State. He has no idea why he's spent so much time there. It kinda smells.

In 2019 he earned his Bachelor of Science in computer science from Montclair State University. He still kinda wishes he went to Rowan but he'll deny it if you ask him. He spent a lot of time with databases, NLP, and environmental science.

He has way too many hobbies for one mortal but his favorites include running, climbing, hiking, and fiddling around with projects he'll never finish.
