Matt Goldeck is a software engineer.

He works for Funnel Leasing. He used to do this in New York City, but he does this remotely now.

He grew up in sunny and desirable Gloucester Township, New Jersey. He lived in Hoboken, New Jersey and now Haddonfield, New Jersey. A sincere personal dream of his is to one day live in a different state.

In 2019 he earned his Bachelor of Science in computer science from Montclair State University. He still kinda wishes he went to Rowan but he'll totally deny if you ask.

He has way too many hobbies for one mortal, but his favorites include running, hiking, history, and fiddling around with projects he'll never finish.
