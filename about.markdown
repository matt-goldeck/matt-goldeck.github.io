Matt Goldeck is a software engineer.

He currently builds integrations for Funnel Leasing. He used to do this in New York City, but he does this remotely now.

He grew up in sunny and desirable Erial, New Jersey, lived in Jersey City, New Jersey, and now weirdly owns a home in Collingswood, New Jersey. He has no idea why he's spent so much time in New Jersey so please don't ask him.

In 2019 he earned his Bachelor of Science in computer science from Montclair State University. He still kinda wishes he went to Rowan but he'll deny it if you ask him. He spent a lot of time with databases, NLP, and environmental science.

He has way too many hobbies for one mortal but his favorites include running, climbing, hiking, and fiddling around with projects he'll never finish.
